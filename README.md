Start => User visits your script page.

User will be asked to connect using his Twitter account using Twitter Auth.

After authentication, my script will pull latest 10 tweets from his “home” timeline.

10 tweets will be displayed using a jQuery-slideshow.

Below jQuery-slideshow (in step#4 from part-1), display list 10 followers (you can take any 10 random followers).

Also, display a search followers box. Add auto-suggest support. That means as soon as user starts typing, his followers will start showing up.

When user will click on a follower name, 10 tweets from that follower’s user-timeline will be displayed in same jQuery-slider, without page refresh.

There will be a download button to download all tweets for logged in user.

Download can be performed in csv format.
